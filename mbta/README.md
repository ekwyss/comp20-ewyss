Wrote three separate files(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create a map
centered on South Station with a red polyline connecting every marked
Red Line subway station. Each station has the same image icon.

Worked alone, used geolocation_map examples, piazza posts, lecture notes,
and developers.google.com for reference.

Time spent: ~2hrs
