#README for lab8/10 MBTA
#Eric Wyss

Wrote three separate files(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create a map
centered on South Station with a red polyline connecting every marked
Red Line subway station. Each station has the same image icon.

Worked alone, used geolocation_map examples, piazza posts, lecture notes,
and developers.google.com for reference.

Time spent: ~2hrs

#Part 2

Modified javascript to add four required features, mark own location on map
using geolocation object, display name of and distance to closest red line
station, have a polyline connecting own marker to closest station, and add
infowindow of upcoming trains to each station.

Worked alone, used redline example, piazza posts, lecture notes, and took
Haversine formula implementation from stackoverflow link in piazza post.

Time spent: ~6.5hrs
